## Lesson 1: Introduction to Pseudo Selectors (2 minutes)

In this lesson, we'll introduce you to the concept of pseudo selectors and how they can help you create more dynamic and exciting web pages.

Pseudo selectors are like a superhero's special glasses that let them see hidden things. Just like those glasses, pseudo selectors help you select and style parts of a web page that you can't normally see or select easily.

CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is a way to tell a web page how to look, such as what colors to use or how big images should be. Pseudo selectors are a special kind of rule in CSS that can do things like select only certain parts of a text or style elements when you interact with them.

For example, imagine you have a button on your web page. You want it to change color when you hover your mouse over it. You can use a pseudo selector called `:hover` to make this happen.

In this course, we'll explore different types of pseudo selectors and show you how to use them to create more engaging web designs. By the end of the course, you'll be able to harness the power of pseudo selectors to make your web pages more dynamic and interactive.

In the next lesson, we'll dive into our first three pseudo selectors: `:hover`, `:visited`, and `:first-child`. Get ready to discover the magic of CSS pseudo selectors!
