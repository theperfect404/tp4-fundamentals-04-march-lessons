It will be a fun and short session where we'll discuss what you've learned so far, whether you've enjoyed the learning experience, and ways we can improve. We hope to see everyone in the next session, as it's the last session of the course.**

Please submit your final projects by 11:59 PM on 21st April at the latest. You have two weeks to complete the final projects. If you have any questions or need help, please feel free to ask. We'll be happy to assist.

At the end of the course, we will review each student's final projects and share the following details with you:

- What you've done well
- Areas for improvement
